    <p>My name is <b>Damion Russell</b> and I love programming. The joy of learning new things and making something from scratch has always been exciting to me.
    I have been programming on and off since I first built my PC in 2015 mostly using the Unity game engine. I have taken a few courses through Coursera, The Odin Project, TrueCoders and
    a few other miscellaneous sources to teach me languages like C#, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and python. Below is a link to my github so you can see some of the things I've been working on.</p>
